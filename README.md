# BookStore Project

## Overview
This project is a [Bookstore program that was coded using Java]. It aims to [store various different types of information using ArrayLists, class inheritance, and arrays].

## Features
- **Feature 1**: Create an Account: Implemented a create an account option, which contains user balance. Upgrades to become a premium member for $10 a month are available, and a premium member would have access to special deals and discounts on items that other customers would pay full price for. 
- **Feature 2**: Purchasing an Item: The purchasing system provided three possible item types for purchase: books, CDs, and DVDs. It displays the item's price, purchases the item, and displays the decrease of that item in the inventory. If the item was the last one left, the inventory would print "sold out" next to the item.
- **Feature 3**: Returning an Item: The returning an item function updates user balance and raises the item's inventory in the displaying current inventory function.
